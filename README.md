# Darey_Project9
This project extends the tooling website deployement by adding some automating for deployment with Continuous Integration using Jenkins

This line was addedd after configuring Webhooks.

- This line was added after configuring Jenkins to work with the NFS Server using Open SSH.
- This is the next attempt as the first didnt succed but threw an unstable error.
- Another attempt. This time I set the timeout to 0.
- Another trial
- It worked this time around after running the command: `sudo chmod 777 -r /mnt/apps`
- Why do I have to suffer thusfrom Jenkins?
- I finally got round to getting the jobs to build without failure.
